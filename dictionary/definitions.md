### Dictionary

____

#### _Accessibility_

Basically, this is the ability of a website to be used by people with disabilities, including visually impaired visitors using screen readers, hearing impaired visitors using no sound, color blind people, or those with other disabilities. A website with low accessibility is basically going to be impossible for those with disabilities to use. Accessibility is particularly important for sites providing information to those with disabilities (healthcare sites, government sites, etc.), though it is an important aspect to consider when designing any site.

____

#### _AJAX_

Stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is typically used for creating dynamic web applications and allows for asynchronous data retrieval without having to reload the page a visitor is on. The JavaScript on a given page handles most of the basic functions of the application, making it perform more like a desktop program instead of a web-based one.

____

#### _API (Application Program Interface)_

  - A set of functions, procedures, methods or classes used by computer programs to request services from the operating system, software libraries or any other service providers running on the computer. A computer programmer uses the API to make application programs. Types of API include web services API like the Twitter API, which allows programs to use the API to receive updates on tweets.

____

#### _Argument_

  - The actual value passed in to a function or method. See also: Params.

____

#### _ASP.NET_

ASP.NET is a server-side web application framework that is designed for web
development. It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic
websites, web applications and web services. ASP.NET pages have a file extension of
.aspx. These files typically contain HTML markup, as well as markup defining serverside
web controls and user controls. This type of programming language is
most commonly hosted on a Windows server
____

#### _Async / Asynchronous_

    - Means that a script will send a request to the server, and continue it's execution without waiting for the reply. As soon as reply is received a browser event is fired, which in turn allows the script to execute associated actions. [Further analogies.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4559032/easy-to-understand-definition-of-asynchronous-event)

____

#### _Callbacks (Higher order functions)_

  - A callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function (let's call this other function “otherFunction”) as a parameter, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside the otherFunction. [More.](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/)

____

#### _Cache_

Web cache is a mechanism for the temporary storage (or caching) of web
documents to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. It lets you set aside
a section of your computer’s hard disk to store representations that you’ve
seen. As you jump from web page to web page, caching those pages in
memory lets you quickly go back to a page without having to download it
from the web again.

____

#### _CLI (command line interface)_

      - A user interface to a computer's operating system or an application in which the user responds to a visual prompt by typing in a command on a specified line, receives a response back from the system. Examples: Terminal, iTerm2, MS-DOS.

____

#### _Client-Side_

Client-side refers to scripts that are run in a viewer’s browser, instead of on a web server (as in server-side scripts). Client-side scripts are generally faster to interact with, though they can take longer to load initially.

____

#### _Compiled and interpreted languages_

Compiled languages (like C, C++, and Swift) require you to compile and build your code into a self-contained binary application before it can be distributed and run.

Interpreted languages (like Python, PHP, and JavaScript) are run by the language’s interpreter on the host machine by reading the code directly, and providing instructions to the computer to execute the program.

____

#### _Content Management System (CMS)_

A content management system (CMS) is a software system that provides website
administration tools so users with little knowledge of web programming languages or
markup languages can create and manage website content with relative ease. Examples
of different types of CMS systems are ExpressionEngine, Wordpress, Joomla,
Concrete5, and Drupal.

____

#### _Closure_

  - A really confusing concept, A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables. More info.

____

#### _Cross-origin/CORS/Xorigin_

    - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows resources (e.g. fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the site on which that resource exists. If an AJAX request fails, there is a significant chance that CORS has been restricted for that site (to not allow outside data requests).

____

#### _DNS_

   - DNS (Domain Name Service) is effectively the phonebook of the internet. It allows humans to search for sensible human domain name, instead of things like IP addresses. When you visit a site, the DNS finds the IP address assosciated with that URL and connects your computer.

____

#### _Elastic Layout_

An elastic layout is one that uses percentages and ems for widths paired with a max-width style to allow the site layout to stretch when font sizes are changed. It’s ability to flex to accommodate the browser width and reader’s font preferences are where it gets its name.

____

#### _Hoisting_

  - Hoisting is Javascript's default behaviour, moving all declared variables to the top of the current scope before they've been assigned values. [Examples here.](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp)

____

#### _IDE_

Short for Integrated Development Environment, an IDE is a development tool (or collection of tools) used to develop for particular languages, including code editors, compilers, debuggers, and other utilities. Popular IDEs include Apple’s Xcode, Microsoft’s Visual Studio, and Java IDEs like IntelliJ, NetBeans, and Eclipse. Whatever your language, there’s an IDE for it.

____

#### _Immutable_

    - In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object (unchangeable object) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

____

#### _IP address_

  - An Internet Protocol Address is a unique address assigned to any decive on the web. It is the means by which machines locate one another. In much the same way we would use a web address (like www.example.com), machines use IP addresses.

____

#### _Operators_

  - **Comparison operators** Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

  **Examples;**

  |Operator|Meaning                  |True Statements      |
  |:-------|:------------------------|:--------------------|
  |==      |Equality                 |28 == '28', 28 == 28 |
  |===     |Strict Equality          |28 === 28            |
  |!=      |Inequality               |28 != 27             |
  |!==     |Strict Inequality        |28 !== 23            |
  |>       |Greater than             |28 > 23              |
  |>=      |Greater than or Equal to |28 >= 28             |
  |<       |Less than                |24 < 28              |
  |<=      |Less than or Equal to    |24 <= 24             |

  - **Logical operators** Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When they are, they return a Boolean value.

  |Operator|Meaning|True Expressions|
  |:-------|:------|:---------------|
  |&&      |AND    |4 > 0 && 4 < 10 |
  |&#124;&#124; |OR     |4 > 0 &#124;&#124;  4 < 3  |
  |!       |NOT    |!(4 < 0)        |

____

#### _Object-oriented programming (OOP)_

   - Refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.

#### _Params / Parameters_

  - The variable in a method/function definition `(var myFunction = function( iAmAParameter ){};)`. See also: Arguments.

____

#### _Persistent Elements_

Persistent elements are items that will appear in the header and footer of every page of
your website site. These are the most important elements on the page, including the
navigation. Most of the time, the action you’re hoping site visitors will take (your
primary conversion) should be a persistent element

____

#### _Primitive data types_

  - A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods. Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation. Javascript for instance, has 6 types:
    - Strings - things in quotes. `"I'm a string."`
    - Numbers - Raw number values. `1 2.3` (not "1").
    - Booleans - `True False`
    - Null - A value that has been explicitly told it has no value.
    - Undefined - A value that has not been defined.
    - Symbols (new in ECMAScript 2015)

____

#### _Promises_

  - Code that executes depending on the response of the code it's attached to. For instance `.done()` is a promise that will run once a task has been completed. [Further reading.](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261)

____

#### _Responsive Design_

A website created with responsive programming adapts and optimizes according the
size of a user’s screen – from desktop to tablet to mobile device. The layout of the site is
elastic – it stretches and enlarges to look great on large screens, and shrinks and
shuffles to stack into a single column for small screens. With a single website, you can
offer an optimal website browsing experience to every user. Responsive is superfriendly,
and it’s the closest thing we have to future-proofing websites. Building a traditional,
fixed-width website is obsolete.

____

#### _Scope_

  - JS
    - JS
    - Global: A variable available to any code following the definition of that variable.
    - Local: A variable that is only available within that object.
    - Block: A variable only available between curly brackets.

  - Ruby
    - Class variable (@@a_variable): Available from the class definition and any sub-classes. Not available from anywhere outside.
    - Instance variable (@a_variable): Available only within a specific object, across all methods in a class instance. Not available directly from class definitions.
    - Global variable ($a_variable): Available everywhere within your Ruby script.
    - Local variable (a_variable): As above, available only within your method/loop etc.

____

#### _Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)_

Secure Sockets layer (SSL) is a security technology that allows an encrypted connection
between you and a server. An SSL certificate contains the data your server will use for
the encryption.

Typically, when you're sending data from one machine to another, it's sent as plain text.
If your site sends vulnerable data (such as passwords or credit card numbers) without
an SSL, that data could be intercepted by attackers. With SSL in place, the transmitted
data is encrypted.

You can tell when a site is protected with an SSL by the green lock symbol next to the
URL in your browser. The URL will also have an “S” (which stands for secure) after
HTTP. If your website has a secure certificate, you’ll likely need dedicated hosting.

____

#### _Server_

  - A server is a computer program that provides services to other computer programs (and their users) in the same or other computers. The computer that a server program runs in is also frequently referred to as a server. That machine may be a dedicated server or used for other purposes as well.

____

#### _SOAP_

Stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. It’s an XML-based protocol exchanging information across the internet to allow an application on one site to access an application or database on another site.

____

#### _Strongly & Weakly typed languages_

  - The difference between a strongly typed language and a weakly typed language is basically that a strongly typed language checks the type of a variable before performing an operation on it, whereas a weakly typed language does not. In addition, strongly typed languages require explicit casts, while weakly typed languages perform implicit casts.

____

#### _undefined_

    - A value that has no definition. You'll most often see this if you are trying to call or return a variable thai is either out of scope, or spelled incorrectly.

____

#### _XHR/XMLHttpRequest_

  - Abbreviated as XHR, XMLHttpRequest is a set of APIs that can be used by Web browser scripting languages, such as JavaScript to transfer XML and other text data to and from a Web server using HTTP.
